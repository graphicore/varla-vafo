# Calibrate CSS

An important but often overlooked property of the CSS-unit system is that,
on screens, its absolute length units don't describe what their names
imply. The reasons are historical and the current status quo allows authors
to design without thinking about the deeper nature of their target devices,
like size and viewer distance, which is a good thing. However, the
consequences are that a CSS-Pixel is likely not a hardware pixel on the
display and that a CSS-Inch is likely not a real world physical Inch.
Regarding the latter, two categories of use cases are made infeasible or
hard to implement:

 * measuring or proofing
 * accurate design, especially for [fixed media](#excursion-the-tale-of-fixed-media)

This article is about enabling CSS-authors to work with real world physical
measurements and to make it easier to do so.

## "A robust and minimal calibration scheme"

This is a demo of a simple widget that let's you, the user, calibrate your
screen, so that it can confidently display real world distance units.
Calibration is a big word, I hope the widget demonstrates sufficiently,
that it is *quickly done* and *not a big deal*.

<div class="insert_calibration_widget"></div>

If the widget was used correctly, we can now use real-world sizes:

One real centimeter: <span class="sample-physical" style="--sample-size: 1cm"></span>
One real inch: <span class="sample-physical" style="--sample-size: 1in"></span>

The result is set to a custom property in CSS on `:root` as `--unit-scale-physical` its value
is <code class="insert insert-unit-scale-physical"></code>.

There's a *caveat*: the example expects square pixels. Generally it is possible
to calibrate width and height separately. However, on the web reasonable
square pixels can be expected and if they aren't square it should be tackled
on a different layer, e.g. OS or device driver.

The calibration widget was inspired by [my own experiment](../techniques/absolute_units_evaluation.html)
and an [#614 issue comment](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614#issuecomment-611217635)
(now also [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths))
where @tabatkins describes a calibration page workaround:

> Notably, this would basically be:
>
> 1. Have a calibration page, where you ask the user to measure
>    the distance between two lines that are some CSS distance apart
>    (say, `10cm`), and input the value they get.
> 2. Use this to find the scaling factor necessary for that screen
>    (CSS length divided by user-provided length), and store it locally
>    (via localStorage, or a cookie, etc).
> 3. On the pages where you need the accurate length, fetch it from
>    local storage, and set a `--unit-scale: 1.07;` (subbing
>    in the real value) property on the `html` element.
> 4. Anywhere you use a length that needs to be accurate, instead of
>    `width: 5cm;`, write `width: calc(5cm * var(--unit-scale, 1));`.
>
> This is a robust and minimal calibration scheme that will
> "fail open" - if the user hasn't calibrated, or clears local data, or
> has JS turned off, it'll just use standard CSS units (due to the , 1
> default arg for the unit scale), rather than breaking.

In the meantime, there's also an entry in the [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths),
describing  the history and status of the topic and a new
[issue #5986 \[css-env\] Device Pixel Ratio](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5986)
trying to move the discussion forward.

### Disclosure

As of beginning this, I don't know if a good case can be built, but
I'm instinctively biased towards having the ability to use real world
physical sizes in CSS. I found out about the bigger discussion right after
collecting my observations in [Real World Absolute Length Units Evaluation](../techniques/absolute_units_evaluation.html).

### Contribute

I understand this as an open document, meaning that contributions
are welcome via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/graphicore/varla-varfo/issues)
and [Pull Requests on the actual document](https://github.com/graphicore/varla-varfo/blob/main/explorations/calibrate/index.html).
But this openness also means it's possible, even likely, that the article
changes over time. The change history can be examined via git, but when
quoting, it may still be a good idea to keep the current git commit hash
of the repository HEAD commit:
[`{{ site.github.build_revision | slice: 0, 10 }}`]({{site.github.repository_url}}/commit/{{site.github.build_revision}}).


## Debunking

Sometimes arguments are made that are not adding value to the discussion.
There are similar badly shaped arguments on both sides and I hope to get
by without having to dispute each of the low quality ones in here.

### Critique of the CSS-Reference-Pixel

Examples where the CSS-Reference-Pixel model solves issues, that seem to
be harder to tackle in the physical-measurements model, are often used as
counterpoints to having access to physical measurements in CSS at all. This
kind of argumentation should be considered bad style, rather than disputing
that, I'm going to explain where I see the shortcomings of the
CSS-Reference-Pixel. I hope this will show why **a complementary model**
with some sort of access to physical measurements is necessary. I do believe
the CSS-Reference-Pixel is in general a very good idea.

The way the CSS-Reference-Pixel *"just works"* is, irrespective of its fancy
definition via the visual angle and viewing distance, a simple *"just
scale everything”*, so that it looks to be the same size, regardless of
the viewing distance.

While this has proven to work in many cases, it breaks down when it comes
to situations where **precision and fidelity are required**, either by the
the nature of the viewing situation or by the diligence of the author
who wants to create the best possible design.

### Excursion: The Tale of Fixed Media

In spite of all the reasons, why physical measurements are said to fail or not,
we do already [have](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#absolute-lengths)
the concept of *"anchoring"* especially for *"print media"* to physical
measurements:

> For a CSS device, these dimensions are anchored either
>
> 1. by relating the physical units to their physical measurements, or
> 2. by relating the pixel unit to the reference pixel.
>
> For print media at typical viewing distances, the anchor unit should be
> one of the standard physical units (inches, centimeters, etc). For screen
> media (including high-resolution devices), low-resolution devices, and
> devices with unusual viewing distances, it is recommended instead that
> the anchor unit be the pixel unit. For such devices it is recommended
> that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that
> best approximates the reference pixel.

#### Typical Viewing Distance

… is tricky: it's not explicitly set anywhere in the device, nor does the
spec document it or explain how to determine it. Instead, it is left to
device manufacturers, operating systems and user preferences to somehow
come to a scaling factor that pleases or is good enough, *there's no
precision*. Usually backwards from there, *if we know some real world
measurement of the screen like PPI, its measurements or the `--unit-scale-physical`
factor*, we can [calculate](#calculate-device-typical-viewing-distance)
what the typical viewing distance is i.e. **the viewing distance at which
the device matches the CSS-Reference-Pixel**. In the context of this article,
this is how the term is used. *Note:* calculation from PPI or screen measurements
would require additional information, like `window.devicePixelRatio` or
`window.screen.width`.

#### The Golden Hammer

The big question is: **If the CSS-Reference-Pixel is the golden hammer
that fixes all of our problems, why would anyone ever want to anchor to
physical measurements, even in print?**

Although I've seen claims that printers do not produce accurate output,
in my tests with my home printer the measurements are *highly accurate*.
The scale option in the print dialog is however an easy to trigger source
of error, always set it to 100 % and don't allow to "fit to page width" or
similar. (If that doesn't fix it, the calibration scheme described in here
works for print as well!)

The claim I made, that the CSS-Reference-Pixel is a simple
scheme of *"just scale everything”* can be illustrated well using
the print dialog. Consider the ISO 216 (DIN 476) A-paper-format, in this
example we designed a flyer for an A6 postcard format. The design is set
in absolute units and the printer (A) anchors to physical measurements.
We know that at `28 inches` distance, "nominal arm’s length", our flyer design
matches the CSS-Reference-Pixel. A1 is `~ 5.65` (= <code>(√2)<sup>5</sup></code>)
times larger than A6, that puts its typical viewing distance to match
the CSS-Reference-Pixel at `158.2 inches` (`5.65 × 28`, `~ 4.02 meter`).
If we send our flyer to a printer (B) to print at A1, the printer in
this case anchors to the CSS-Refernce-Pixel and has determined, that the
typical viewing distance of a A1 Poster is at `158.2 inches`, we get a
perfectly scaled version of our flyer. However, in fact, printers do not
anchor to the CSS-Reference-Pixel. Hence, to get the same result, in our
print dialog we must chose the option "*Scale: Fit to page width*" in other
words *"just scale everything”*.

*Note:* if the typical viewing distance would be a different value in B,
the design would not fit the page exactly and end up either larger or smaller
than the page size, in such a case media-queries could rescue us, but that
applies regardless of the unit anchoring.

With the example in mind we can also rephrase the *big question* and ask:
**If it is that simple, why don't designers make one layout for print and
then *"just scale everything”?***

The answer is simple: design for print doesn't work that way. In fact it
is discredited to take a flyer and just print it as a poster or vice versa.
One would analyze the anticipated viewing conditions and then find a layout
that matches these conditions best. Classically, a poster doesn't
have a single typical viewing distance. Instead, since the size and location
of the poster are fixed and interaction is limited (no zoom, no scroll), viewing
distance becomes an *instrument of design* and *it is not fixed*. One could
say, viewing distance is the primary interaction model of a poster, and it
could work something like this:

 * **viewer is farther** (~ 20 – 10 meters) The poster must capture attention.
 * **viewer is far** (~ 8 – 5 meters) Most important information is revealed (who, what).
 * **viewer is close** (under ~ 3 meters) All required information e.g. to visit the event (when, where, how).
 * **viewer is closer** (under ~ 1 meter) Legal information, contact data etc.

On a smaller flyer the spread of font sizes from "farther" to "closer"
will be less than on a larger poster, the "closer" fonts must get larger,
and the font-size differences between steps must get smaller. The Poster
has more real estate to create visual tension. Put in other words: when
viewed next to each other, scaled to the same size, most apparently, the
large poster design has smaller fonts for the "closer" range, they would
become unreadable small when scaled down to flyer size. But also the
differences between font-sizes in the hierarchy overall will be lesser
in the design for the smaller flyer. It's not a linear scaling at all.

#### Fixed Media

… defined for the purpose of this article, is a superset
of print media, it also includes other media when it has similar properties
to print. Fixed media is not primarily interactive, meaning that it can't
be zoomed, scrolled or clicked by the viewer, it may be paged or animated
though, it may even have interactive aspects, but those are secondary. An
example is digital signage or digital advertisement in public space etc.
The media is "fixed" because it does not appear on the device of the viewer,
rather, the viewer appears and the media is already there, as in fixed
to a wall.

Suppose we have a poster like fixed media advertisement, targeted at poster
like digital signage screens. The screen sizes may still differ across the
deployment. Of course, we design it using the CSS-Reference-Pixel model,
*because that's the golden hammer*, everything gets scaled to fit the
screens according to their typical viewing distance. Of course we want to
stick to our viewing distance based interaction model, *because that's best
practice*, after all, in relative terms "farther", "far", "close", "closer"
can still be expressed in CSS-sizes, just like `xx-large`, `large`, `small`
and `xx-small` can be expressed relative to the default `medium`  `font-size`.


In the fixed media example two differently sized screens are:

|                 | aspect ratio | device pixels   | PPI    | physical measurements                   | the width of … |
|---------------- | :----------: | --------------- | ------:| :-------------------------------------- |:--------------:|
|**small screen** | 9:16         | 2160:3840 (UHD) | 184.62 | 11.7:20.8&nbsp;in (29.7:52.8&nbsp;cm)   | A3             |
|**large screen** | 9:16         | 2160:3840 (UHD) |  65.26 | 33.1:58.8&nbsp;in (84.1:149.5&nbsp;cm ) | A0             |

We could set them up so that they are calibrated to physical units, this
would require setting the `device-pixel-ratio [browser zoom]` (**d-p-r**) for the
small screen to `1.92 [192%]` (`~1125:2000 CSS-px`) and for the large screen
to `0.68 [68%]` (`~3176:5647 CSS-px`). Now both screens would
have a default viewing distance of 28 inches and a print-media to screen-media
transformation would work seamlessly. But this would be an extreme
setup, it is also exactly like the calibration this article is trying to
establish.

More typical would be if the small screen had a d-p-r
of maybe `2 [200%]` (`1080:1920 CSS-px`), putting its typical viewing
distance at `29.11 inches` (`73.96 centimeters`), and the large screen had a
d-p-r of maybe `3 [300%]` (`720:1280 CSS-px`), putting
its typical viewing distance at `123.57 inches` (`313.86 centimeters`).

If the larger screen was set to `2 [200%]` as well, we would have no way
in CSS to distinguish it from the small screen, from the perspective of a
media query it would look in every aspect the same. Thus the resulting
image would have to be the same as on the small screen, just scaled.
Fortunately, we set it differently, that screen in media queries would
appear to be smaller in CSS-units and also have to receive the styles of
the larger design. **This heuristic is not only counter intuitive, it is
also arbitrary**. If we design like this, we are going to have the same
result for the A0 sized screen also when viewing on a mobile phone, because
to us they appear to be the same.

#### The Lesson Learned

At this moment we can end this excursion. From looking at screen sizes
that are normalized with the CSS-Reference-Pixel model, we can't possibly
make conclusions about the physical sizes, that's by the way the whole
point of the model, and **therefore we can't optimize our design for
fixed media**. The results that are permissible must be oriented at
whatever works at a distance of an arm’s length. This is actively harmful
for general design quality. Like clipping in signals, it's limiting the
range of expression and the precision that good design offers, in German
we have a word for what is left: **"Einheitsbrei"** (~ uniformity-mush).

### Absolute Physical Measurements Would Mess with Zooming.

Where zooming is possible we must not take it away, it simply has higher
priority. If there's an important reason why something must be displayed
true to scale, the page or app should inform the user and if possible
detect zooming and warn. Moreover, Page-Zoom already invokes media-queries,
these will keep working and added support for the new model will improve
the situation further. Ways to handle the fact of zooming will evolve,
it's not a blocker.

There are however also [situations where zooming is not possible](#excursion-the-tale-of-fixed-media),
the UA may not be controllable by the viewer, in those cases, informed
design with physical measurements will likely help to improve the situation,
rather than having the CSS-Reference-Pixel impose a not ideal solution.

### Browsers are bad at reliably and accurately knowing the actual size and resolution of your display.

*Paraphrased from the [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths).*

That's why [the proposal](#browser-support-roadmap) is to have **a progressively
enhancing model**. Some devices can be very reliable, like phones and tablets,
where the display is integrated, these devices could just work. In other
cases the best solution is to ask the user for calibration via a widget,
similar to the one that is demonstrated here. The calibration could happen
on the page directly, but it would be ideal if the user agent or the OS
could provide this service. In my opinion, the user agent would be the sweet
spot to implement this. The page or app could provide its own widget as
a polyfill until it has stabilized.

If the hardware/system reports display sizes, it would in any case be necessary
that the user can control and, where required, override that information
with own measurements, using a calibration widget.

### Authors would misuse accurate real-world units and give users a bad experience.

*Paraphrased from the [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths).*

We should not protect authors from their own inability, instead teach them
how to use these tools to achieve the best for their users. Also that the
CSS-Reference-Pixel should be their default choice.

The argument could also be turned around, identifying cases where the
automatism provided by the CSS-Reference-Pixel gives users a bad or
worse than ideal experience, and since CSS has no escape mechanism yet,
this could be identified as a form of violence.

It's OK that working with real physical measurements would make some
things harder, the gist is that it would enable other things that are
impossible to achieve under the CSS-Reference-Pixel. Despite, models
would be **complementary**, there's no need to pick a side.

### We would break interoperability/the internet.

If we can't break anything, it will also be hard to do any good. We got
to think of authors to act in good faith, that they want to create working
designs, that they work hard to achieve that and that they will find elegant
solutions to difficult problems.

Let's instead focus on *the tools that we already have in CSS* to make
robust designs and that will stay available. Because, without these tools,
even the CSS-Reference-Pixel would fail to deliver on its promise.

There are:

 * Relative length units, like `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw` etc.
 * Percentages `%`
 * CSS functions, like `min()`, `max()`, `calc()`, `clamp()` and `var()`
 * overflow controls
 * Media Queries, although, these would have to beef up a bit.

And not to forget, the CSS-Reference-Pixel model will also stay
available at all time, either to complement or — especially with media
query support — we could create e.g. hybrid pages that leverage the best
of both models.

## Use Cases

### Calculate Device Typical Viewing Distance

The typical viewing distance for which a screen is set up, to match the
CSS-Reference-Pixel, is usually opaque to the user as well as to the
CSS-author. One result of that is, that it is hard to asses whether a
device displays contents too big or too small, or **how far away from
a device one should be to enjoy that standard.**

From the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#absolute-lengths):

> The reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with
> a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm’s
> length. For a nominal arm’s length of 28 inches [71,12 centimeters],
> the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees. For reading at
> arm’s length, 1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).

With a calibration as established above, it's simple to calculate the
implied viewing distance for this screen:

`let unitScalePhysical = `<code class="insert insert-unit-scale-physical"></code>`;`

JavaScript, calculating `normalReadingDistance` in inches:

```js

/* It's sufficient to just scale the nominal arm's length: */

let normalReadingDistance = 28 / unitScalePhysical;

/* Alternatively the same result can be calculated using the visual angle,
 * but this can be simplified to the above.
 */

let alpha = Math.atan2(1/96/2, 28),
    normalReadingDistance = 1/96/2/unitScalePhysical/Math.tan(alpha);
```

On your device the reading distance to have one CSS-pixel to appear at an visual angle of 0.0213 degrees is:

<strong class="insert insert-normal-reading-distance"></strong>

In other words at that distance, one inch would appear as big as one physical
inch appears when viewed from a distance of 28 inches.

## Browser Support Roadmap

Conceiving a roadmap how progressive browser support could be established
in four milestones.

### Level 0

Now. The workaround [calibration widget](#css-calibration-widget) exists
and it is proven to work. Authors can start to use physical measurements,
to experiment, find solutions and usage patterns and to lead by example.
We can get the word out, search for allies and create momentum.


TODO: Call to action -> send links to pages that implement the
calibration scheme and we are going to it to this document.

TODO: start a list of links at the end of this document.

We can **improve the user experience around the calibration process** of a
website or app that uses physical measurements. The user should be notified
that a page uses calibration, ask the user to check from time to time if
calibration values are correct. Maybe we can try to make educated guesses
when calibration is off (e.g. a `window.screen` and `window.devicePixelRatio`
finger print could be saved along with the calibration value. Detect zoom
and find ways to handle it gracefully  etc. This effort would aim to make
the user experience good and solid but also to **show a way how UAs could
implement calibration directly.**

The way browsers handle user permissions e.g. "Send Notifications" or
"Open Pop-up Windows" has potential. If permissions are set there's an
icon in the address bar that toggles a "Site information" widget that can
be used to make settings. The same thing is also used to inform about the
connection security status. Maybe, in the future, a native UA calibration
tool could piggyback on that if a page uses calibration features.

![Browser permissions handling in address bar](./assets/browser-permissions-handling.png)

TODO: add a call to action to collaborate on the calibration widget UX!


### Level 1

A CSS `env(unit-scale-physical)` property is the main goal. At the same
time, this is the hardest one to convince the CSS Working Group of, some
minds are already made up because similar attempts were made in the past
and because it would involve some effort on the browser vendor site.

One big contra argument always was that the calibration information would
involve getting reliable information from the hardware and that this can’t
be done 100 % reliably all the time. As described in [Level 0](#level-0),
we can lead the way and show how to do this with user calibration as fallback.
On the positive side, *it's not 100 % of devices either that **can't** report
reliable information.*

UA/Browser support for `env(unit-scale-physical)` would improve the user
experience a lot, and make the usage of physical measurements feasible
for many more pages. **Much less** calibration would have to be performed,
it would work across pages and also UAs could maybe also decide better if
a calibration must be invalidated and renewed, e.g. when the screen has
changed.

The calibration widget could act as a polyfill until UAs catch up.

### Level 2

**Media-query support** would be incredibly useful. I’m not proposing how
exactly these media-queries will have to look. With the experience coming
from Level 0 and Level 1, we'll be able to describe precisely what kind
of media-queries are required. This would enable authors to improve cross
device interoperability a lot.


### Level 3

A new CSS property `unit-anchoring: physical|pixel|author`
With access to the scale factor, would be a logical consequence.

Technically it is already possible to anchor a document to physical
measurements instead of the CSS-Reference-Pixel, but it is complicated:

```css
/* Applied on :root this will anchor the entire website to
 * physical units.
 */
.physical-unit-anchoring {
    /* Scale everything. */
    `transform: scale(env(unit-scale-adjust))`;
    /* The visual default font-size of the user can be preserved. */
    font-size: calc(100% / env(unit-scale-adjust));
    /* Reset page width to pre-transform size. */
    width: calc(100% / env(unit-scale-adjust));
}
```

*Note:* on `:root` this works better than on any generic element,
especially because the `transform` size changes of the element are not
compensated well in this example, i.e. element height in block direction
would need adaptions, but these differ on a case by case basis.

According to the CSS spec, a UA can already decide to anchor to physical
measurements. With this, there would be a way from within CSS to ask the
UA to do a specific anchoring. Together with Level 2 media query support
it would be entirely possible to use this safely without having to compromise
on interoperability or future proofness.
